# Running Planner

A simple **Vue.js** application with a datepicker and tabs. A user can select a date, based on which the training program for the 5 km race is calculated. The program consists of 16 days, during which the duration and distance gradually increases up to five kilometers. The project is made with **Vuex**. I used **Vue Tasty Burgers** for hamburger menu button on mobile.

Check out the [demo link](https://ni4yja.github.io/running-planner/) and read my [article on Medium](https://ni4yja.medium.com/running-planner-vue-js-application-4784f0560ec4) about the project.

**Updated:** Now a user can toggle complete each day status and the data will be saved to the Local Storage.
